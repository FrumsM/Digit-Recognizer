# Digit-Recognizer

**The project is based on participating in a Kaggle competition:** https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

To achieve this objective, I developed an 9-layer Sequential Convolutional Neural Network. I opted to use the Keras API with the TensorFlow backend, which offers an intuitive approach. Initially, I preprocessed the data, consisting of handwritten digit images, and concentrated on constructing and evaluating the CNN model.

Mertic: Accuracy
